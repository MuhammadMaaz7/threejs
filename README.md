# Three JS Tutorials

This repository is where I store my learning process about Three JS and 3D web development.

I will be following the official Three JS tutorials, as well as other resources such as YouTube tutorials, blog posts, etc.

The tutorials will be organized in different folders, each folder will contain the code for a specific tutorial.

I will also be adding notes and comments to the code to help me understand what each part of the code is doing.

The purpose of this repository is to help me learn Three JS and 3D web development, and to have a reference for future projects.
